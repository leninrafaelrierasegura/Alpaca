<h1>Filters</h1>
<p>Let <code>X_k(t_i)</code> denote the value of a stock
<code>X_k</code> at day <code>t_i</code>, where <code>i= 0,...,N</code>.
Let <code>pct X_k(t_i)</code> denote the percentage change of
<code>X_k(t_i)</code> with respect to <code>X_k(t_0)</code>, i.e.,
<code>pct X_k(t_i) = (X_k(t_i) - X_k(t_0))/X_k(t_0) * 100</code>. For
each stock <code>X_k</code>, the filters are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first filter is that <code>X_k(t_0) &lt;= X_k(t_N)</code>,
i.e., the stock must have a positive growth trend within the period of
analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>The second filter is that
<code>0.8*X_k(t_{i-1}) &lt;= X_k(t_i) &lt;= 2*X_k(t_{i-1})</code>, i.e.,
the next day price is at most twice and at least 80% of the last price
(from day to day it can only fall 20%).</p></li>
<li><p>The third filter is that
<code>max{ pct X_k(t_0), ..., pct X_k(t_{N-1})} / 2 &lt;= pct X_k(t_N)</code>,
i.e., the final price growth is at least half of the highest
growth.</p></li>
<li><p>The fourth filter is that
<code>min{|pct X_k(t_0)|, ..., |pct X_k(t_{N-1})|} &lt;= pct X_k(t_N)</code>,

<h1>Rankings</h1>
<p>Let <code>R_j</code> be the rank of the stocks according to their
percentage change <code>pct X_k(t_i)</code> at day <code>t_i</code>. The
ranks is computed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Accumulated rank</code>. More complicated than the others.
The idea is to compute the rank of each stock at each date, and then
accumulate the ranks according to the following logic:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code>R_j(t_i) &gt;= R_j(t_{i-1})</code>, then
<code>R_j(t_i) = R_j(t_{i-1}) + R_j(t_i)</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>R_j(t_i) &lt; R_j(t_{i-1})</code>, then
<code>R_j(t_i) = R_j(t_{i-1}) - R_j(t_i)</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that if a stock has a better rank than the previous day,
its accumulated rank increases by the value of its current rank. If it
has a worse rank, its accumulated rank decreases by the value of its
current rank.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Sum of ranks</code>. This is simply
<code>R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_N</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Last day rank</code>. This is simply
<code>R_N</code>.</p></li>
